**Introduction:**

  A comprehensive analysis of consultancy services data to evaluate consultant performance, client 
  retention, revenue generation, and payment patterns. The analysis aims to provide actionable 
  insights into revenue optimization and business operations for consultancy firms.
  
**Goal:**
  To analyze consultancy projects, client behavior, and consultant performance using advanced SQL 
  techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Window Functions. The project helps uncover 
  trends in revenue, detect payment delays, and improve client retention strategies.  

**Description:**
   - **Define Scope:** Focus on consultancy project data, including consultant performance, client 
       engagement, project revenue, and payment patterns.
   - **Data Collection:** Sample datasets were generated to represent clients, consultants, projects, 
       and invoices for the consultancy firm.
   - **Revenue Generation:** Analyze invoice data to identify the top-performing consultants and 
       clients based on revenue.
   - **Payment Delays:** Track payment statuses to calculate average payment delays and unpaid 
       invoices.
   - **Client Retention:** Identify repeat clients and calculate retention rates using project data.
   - **Consultant Performance:** Evaluate consultant performance by analyzing project duration, total 
       working hours, and generated revenue.
     
**Skills:**
   - SQL for advanced querying, data analysis, and database management.
     
  - PostgreSQL techniques like CTEs, Window Functions, and aggregate functions for deep analysis.
